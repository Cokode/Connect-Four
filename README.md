Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game involving strategy and spatial reasoning. The game is played on a vertical grid with seven columns and six rows, resulting in 42 slots for game pieces.

Players take turns dropping colored discs (usually red and yellow) into the columns from the top. The discs fall to the lowest available space within the chosen column. The goal is to be the first to create a line of four of your own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game ends in a draw if the grid becomes full without a player achieving a line of four. Connect Four is appreciated for its simplicity, yet it requires strategic planning and anticipation to outwit the opponent and create winning combinations while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
